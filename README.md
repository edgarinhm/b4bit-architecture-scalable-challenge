# Cloud Architecture for a Scalable Data Processing System Using Terraform

## Objective

Design, implement, and deploy a scalable cloud-based solution for a data aggregation
system using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC). The system should handle data
ingestion, processing, and storage securely and efficiently.

### Reference Architecture Design

#### 5 Logical Layers Composed of Purpose-Built Components

- Source: Devices or applications that produce real-time data at high velocity
- Stream ingestion: Data from tens of thousands of data sources can be collected and ingested in real time
- Stream storage: Data is stored in the order received for a set time and can be replayed indefinitely during that time
- Stream processing: Records are read in the order they’re produced, allowing for real-time analytics or streaming ETL
- Destination: Data lake Data warehouse Database OpenSearch Event driven Applications

#### Pipeline Overview

The batch processing pipeline consists of six key stages:

1. Data Ingestion (Extract)
2. Data Transformation (Transform)
3. Data Storage (Load)
4. Orchestration & Automation
5. Monitoring & Optimization
6. Security & Governance

#### 1. Efficient Data Ingestion (Extract)

Ingesting large datasets efficiently is the first challenge in building a robust data pipeline. A pipeline must handle massive volumes of data reliably, even during spikes in traffic.

#### 2. Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Data Transformation (Transform)

Data transformation is where raw data is cleaned, filtered, aggregated, and prepared for analysis. The transformation stage should be designed to handle large-scale distributed processing with minimal operational overhead.

#### 3. Efficient and Optimized Data Storage (Load)

Once the data has been processed, it must be stored in a way that supports efficient querying and long-term storage while minimizing cost.

#### 4. Advanced Orchestration & Automation

Data pipelines require robust orchestration to ensure smooth operation, automatic failure recovery, and minimal manual intervention.

#### 5. Monitoring and Continuous Optimization

Monitoring the pipeline’s performance and resource usage is critical for detecting issues early and ensuring optimal performance.

#### 6. Enterprise-Grade Security & Governance

Ensuring data security and regulatory compliance is critical for any data processing pipeline. Governance must be in place to control access and ensure data is protected throughout its lifecycle.
